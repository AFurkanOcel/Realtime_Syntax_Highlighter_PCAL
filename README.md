# üñãÔ∏è Real-Time Syntax Highlighter (PCAL)

This project is a **real-time, grammar-based** syntax highlighter.  
As the user types, the input is analyzed instantly and at least 5 different token types are highlighted.  
The project is developed entirely from scratch, and **no external syntax highlighting libraries are used**.

## üîç Project Overview

The application consists of the following core components:

- **Lexical Analyzer (Lexer)**: Tokenizes the input based on regular expressions.  
- **Syntax Analyzer (Parser)**: Checks the token sequence against a context-free grammar.  
- **Highlighting Engine**: Assigns colors based on token types.  
- **GUI**: Developed using Tkinter, highlights syntax in real-time as the user types.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No ready-made highlighting libraries were used.

## ‚úÖ Highlighted Token Types

| Token Type   | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IDENTIFIER   | Represents variable or function names. Consists of letters.               |
| NUMBER       | Integer constants.                                                         |
| OPERATOR     | Basic mathematical operators such as +, -, *, /.                          |
| EQUALS       | Assignment operator (`=`).                                                 |
| QUESTION     | Used to retrieve the result of an operation (`?`).                         |
| DELIMITER    | Separator for end-of-line (`,` in this project).                           |
| PAREN        | Parentheses to indicate operation precedence (`(` and `)`).               |

### ‚û§ Language and Grammar Selection
The project is implemented using PCAL, a simple, educational language. Its grammar was defined and applied within the project.

### ‚û§ Syntax Analysis
Top-down recursive descent method was used for syntax analysis. Input is validated against the defined grammar.

### ‚û§ Lexical Analysis
The lexer is developed from scratch in Python using regular expressions and operates based on a state diagram.

### ‚û§ Parser Method
Top-down approach using recursive descent technique for syntax validation.

### ‚û§ Highlighting Scheme
Each token type is assigned a distinct color using the `Text` widget with `tag_config()`.

### ‚û§ GUI Implementation
The interface highlights syntax in real-time as the user types. The GUI is simple and user-friendly.
