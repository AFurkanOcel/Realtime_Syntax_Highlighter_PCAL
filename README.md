# Realtime_Syntax_Highlighter_PCAL
PCAL  is a simple, custom-designed mini-language. This project implements a real-time syntax highlighter for PCAL using a custom lexer and top-down parser, built without any external libraries. It highlights at least five token types and includes a GUI for live code editing and instant syntax feedback.
